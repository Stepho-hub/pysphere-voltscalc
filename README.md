# PySphere Assignment 1 – Ohm's Law

## Author
Stephen Omwamba

## Description
This repository contains a simple Python program that calculates **Voltage (V)** using **Ohm’s Law**:

**Formula:**
V = I * R
Where:
- `V` = Voltage (in volts)
- `I` = Current (in amperes)
- `R` = Resistance (in ohms)

## Example Usage
Enter the current (in A): 2.5
Enter the resistance (in ohms): 5
The voltage is: 12.5 volts


## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/pysphere-assignment-1.git

2. Navigate into the folder:
cd pysphere-assignment-1

3. Run the script:
python ohms_law.py
